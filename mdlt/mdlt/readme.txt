                    Image Stitching with Moving DLT
                           (Patent Pending)

The MATLAB demo code in this package implements the non-rigid image 
stitching method proposed in:

"As-Projective-as-Possible Image Stitching with Moving DLT", 
Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Michael Brown and David Suter,
In Proc. Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), Portland, Oregon, USA, 2013.

For using this demo, run the "main.m" file in MATLAB.
(We tried with MATLAB2012 and 2013)

We provide the MEX files for Linux, Windows and MacOSX (64 bit versions only).
If you don't use any of these O.S.s our program will try to generate the MEX files with 
your current CPP compiler. So, make sure you have a CPP compiler with your 
MATLAB installation!.

Please write me an email if you find a problem with this code or if you 
have some possible improvements/suggestions:
